# Heart Disease Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the classification of heart disease using a Jupyter Notebook. The project utilizes a classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features extracted from patient data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the attached CSV file, named heart_disease_data.csv. This file contains information about patients, including several features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Structure

  ### 1. Jupyter Notebook
  
  - The [`heart_disease_classification.ipynb`](heart_disease_classification.ipynb) file contains the entire codebase and the step-by-step process of building the classification model. It also includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.
 
### 2. CSV File

- [`heart_disease_data.csv`](heart_disease_data.csv) is the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.

### 3. Requirements

- The [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file lists all the necessary libraries and their versions required to run the Jupyter Notebook. You can install them using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** (in cmd)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryanrangapur/heart-disease-classification.git
   
   cd heart-disease-classification
2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart_disease_classification.ipynb
4. **Execute the cells in the notebook one by one to understand the project flow.**

   # Results
   The classification model's performance and evaluation metrics are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook. The results provide insights into how well the model can predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on the given features.
